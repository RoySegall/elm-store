# Go store in Elm

You found this repository in two cases - I sent you the address or you searched
for this one. If the first one is the right one, give me a star ;). If the
second one is the right one, Kudos!

## What is this thing?
This is my elm project. I wanted to check elm and see how it was so I created a
"simple" project.

## Setting up
First, go get the [backend](https://github.com/roysegall/go-store) ans follow
the instructions.

Then just run:
```node
npm install -g elm@~0.18.0
npm install
npm run
```


After everything is running  go to http://localhost:8080. Njoy!
